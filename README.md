# Project Euler Starter Pack: Javascript Edition

Starter pack for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives). Written in Javascript, running on node.js, locally hosted in an aesthetically elegant website.

## How to use

* Install `Node.js` and `npm`
* `git clone` the repository.

```bash
cd project-euler-js-website
npm init -y
npm install express
node index.js
```

To get started, the `scripts` folder contains the first 100 problems. Just replace the `0` in this function:
```javascript
exports.solution = () => {
    return 0;
};
```

You can find [solutions online](https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions/blob/master/Solutions.md). I don't think it's cheating to have numerical solutions. After all, you still have to code up your solutions.
